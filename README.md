PRAJWAL


In my Jupyter notebook titled "Twitter Sentiment Analysis Live," I focus on analyzing the sentiment of tweets. Here's a summary of the content from my perspective:

Introduction and Setup: I start by introducing the aim of my project, which is to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data. I include necessary Python library imports like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn for this purpose.

Data Collection and Preprocessing: My project involves collecting Twitter data using the Tweepy library. I detail the process of authenticating with the Twitter API to fetch tweets. Following this, I preprocess the data for analysis, cleaning and structuring the tweets for further processing.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I conduct an exploratory data analysis on the tweet dataset. This includes visualizing data distributions, identifying trends, and extracting insights using various statistical and graphical techniques.

Sentiment Analysis Modeling: The core of my project is building a model for sentiment analysis. I use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the sentiment of tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. This involves feature extraction, model selection, training, and evaluation.

Model Evaluation: I evaluate the performance of the sentiment analysis model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. I use confusion matrices and classification reports to assess the model's effectiveness.

Live Twitter Data Extraction: I also include additional code to extract data from Twitter using the Twitter API. This section allows for real-time analysis of tweets based on user-defined search terms and tweet counts.

Conclusion: I conclude the project with insights drawn from the analysis and discuss the potential applications of the sentiment analysis model.
